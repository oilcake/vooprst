### VOOP

The project is in **really** early stages of development. The basic idea is "Ableto Link enabled video looper", so something like Ableton Live but for video. For now it is only able to load a folder of videos and play them acoorgingly to Link synchronization signals, but without any possibilities to customize behavior and very dumb in terms of UI and actual video playback.

So, stay with us, it may do something useful later :)

If you still want to try:
```bash
just run
```

that will compile it(if you got rust installed) and run against a folder with sample videos unless you set PATH_TO_VIDEO environmental variable that points to a folder with videos.
